        "text": "<p>A very good class C canyon located in the Sierra National Forest below Huntington Lake. The canyon is an exciting all granite descent below the shadow of Kerchoff Dome, and has very nice wet rappels, a couple of lap-worthy slides, and maybe a jump or two if you know where to look...\n</p><p>The best time is usually late summer, as this canyon has too much water to be safely descended in spring. Flow will depend on the amount of snowpack that accumulated in the Sierras. The flow is a combination of dam release and natural creek flow. Though real-time flow data are not currently available, reviewing <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory/?site_no=11237000\">historical Big Creek gauge data</a> yields approximate criteria:\n</p><ul><li>Moderate = ~5 cfs</li>\n<li>Moderate-High > ~6 cfs</li>\n<li>High > 10 cfs</li>\n<li>Very High > ~15 cfs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of the rappels are out of the water flow or allow bypass, so the canyon could be doable even in high water conditions, but this is something only you can judge.\n</p><p>Below I provide pictures of \"normal\" water level taken from two different checkpoints. The amount of whitewater is a good proxy for amount of flow. Judge the feasibility of the canyon by comparing the amount of whitewater in the reference pictures with the conditions that you find.

        "title": "Approach",
        "text": "<p>Park a vehicle at the bottom of the canyon (see map) and then drive up to Huntington Lake all the way till the end of the road (gate). Park there and hike along a forest road to a viewpoint at the top of the tram (green track). As of 8/19/19, there was a well-established shortcut trail that saves 0.7 mi (purple track). From there bushwack your way down into the canyon (orange route) till you reach the stream bed (checkpoint). Suit up here.\n</p><p>For those not using GPS:\n</p><p>Approach: Hike on the road past the road closure gate. You will first pass the sheriff’s house. Afterwards veer right to follow the road below the Huntington Lake dam. The road will make a 180-degree u-turn below the dam and then intersect with a series of other roads. Continue straight on the main road noting a large Penstock on the Left. Soon the road crosses over this penstock so that it is immediately beside the road on the right. After crossing over the penstock continue on down the road. At the end of the road, where a “gate house” is indicated on the 7.5” map (see map) head north-east cross-country and downhill following a lateral ridge while generally staying in the woods. Eventually you’ll intersect a gully. Follow the gully down to Big Creek just above the beginning of the technical section.\n</p><p>Park at the bottom. Hike over to the 3 massive penstock pipes, and climb up the tramway 700 vertical feet to 37.20948, -119.23776 where you will see the an overhead roller above the tramway and a shallow gully to the right.  Follow the animal run in shallow gully to trimmed branches, a few rock cairns and more intersecting animal runs up about 500 feet until the path runs out at 37.21105, -119.23492.  Continue up about another 100 vertical feet, skirting left to avoid the thick brush around some large boulders and then traverse on an animal run to the saddle between the big headwall and Kerckhoff Dome at 37.21104, -119.23289.  At the saddle, continue South climbing slight up to the dome's summit.  Or from the saddle descend down a shallow steep gully on the East slide to the big slide R5 (Note: going down this gully has not be verify as non-technical as of Aug 2020).  From dome summit, enjoy the awesome panoramic view!  There is also a register in a shallow pothole on the summit.  From the summit head East down a corridor of rock faces with large boulders to a short chimney down-climb, then under a boulder and around a bush out onto the East side slab top.  Walk down the slab hugging the bush and rock corner on your left to a large live pine tree.  There are 2 dead pine trees and a large cedar tree too on the East slab.  The large live pine tree is the first rappel off the Dome's East side, and should have a webbing anchor on it.\n</p>"

This rappel can be done less than 90 feet by downclimbing the slab just above the ledge.</li>\n<li>R4 90' from a pinch point under a huge boulder DCL of the large log, down the crunchy lichen covered face in a shady corner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>To do the big slide (R5 below), traverse up canyon nearly level with the bottom of R4 until you are very close to the big slide, then climb up slightly around/through the ferns and down to the top of the big slide.  This is mostly free of brush after the 2020 Creek Fire.\n<br>To continue directly down (R6 below) downclimb around some bushes then head left to a small pine tree and continue to down climb around the steeper rock on your right, past more bushes to short chimney downclimb.  At the bottom of the chimney head right under a boulder then climb back up through a narrow opening to a bush covered ledge.  Head more or less straight down to a pinch point anchor on a clean part of the ledge.\n</p><ul><li>R5 90' from the pinch point to the traverse ledge for R6 described below in the full descent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>Note: you can still to do the big slide (R5 below), by hiking a short ways up canyon from the sneak R5 rappel to the slide bottom and the DCL side of the slide is class 3/4 rock low enough angle to climb up.\n</p><p>The heights of the raps are approximate, do NOT trust them blindly.\n</p><ul><li>R1 50' RDC bolts, rappel down into a pool and beyond\n<ul><li>Option - in very high flow is to rap down far RDC, being careful not to pendulum.
